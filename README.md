# Mental-Health-Treatment-Prediction
Mental health awareness is a growing concern, especially in corporate and tech environments. This project uses machine learning to predict whether an individual will seek mental health treatment based on survey data. The solution includes:
1.A machine learning model
2.A Streamlit web app for predictions
3.A Power BI dashboard for insights
Objectives
Predict treatment-seeking behavior using survey responses
Deploy a user-friendly prediction tool with Streamlit
Visualize trends and patterns using Power BI
Tech Stack
Category	Tools Used
